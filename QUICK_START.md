## What You're Looking At

- **The orbital plane** shows where planets are *right now*
- **Worldlines** (helixes) show where planets have been and will be
- **Time flows upward** — past is below, future is above
- **Red markers** indicate your currently selected time
- **Ghost Earth** (when navigating) shows where Earth is *now* vs your selection

## Tips

1. **Start at Zoom 3 (Year)** to see how Earth's orbit creates a helix through time
2. **Press A/D slowly** to watch Earth spiral through its orbit
3. **Zoom to level 7 (Week)** to see individual days
4. **Press Space** after navigating to smoothly animate back to the present

## Quick Reference

| What You Want | What To Do |
|---------------|------------|
| See the whole solar system | Press `1` or `2` |
| Focus on Earth's orbit | Press `3`, `4`, or `5` |
| See specific days | Press `7` |
| Go back 1 month | Press `4`, then `A` |
| Return to today | Press `Space` or `N` |
| See the Moon | Press `M` |

## Troubleshooting

**Black screen?** Your browser may not support WebGL. Try Chrome or Firefox.

**Slow performance?** Lower zoom levels (1-3) render more geometry. Try zooming in.

**Controls not working?** Click on the visualization first to give it focus.
